# Guessing Game

A simple command-line guessing game written in Rust.

## Overview

In this game, the program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. Your task is to guess the number. After each guess, you'll receive feedback indicating whether your guess was too low, too high, or correct.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust and Cargo:**  
  Make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your system.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd guessing_game
   ```

2. **Build the Project:**
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
   This will compile the project and produce an executable in the `target/release` directory.

## Running the Game

You can run the game directly using Cargo:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

Alternatively, after building, you can run the executable:

```bash
./target/release/guessing_game
```

## How to Play

1. When you run the game, it generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. You'll be prompted to enter your guess.
3. After each guess, the program will inform you if your guess is:
   - **Too low**
   - **Too high**
   - **Correct**
4. The game continues until you guess the correct number.

## Code Overview

- **Random Number Generation:** Uses the `rand` crate to generate a random number.
- **User Input:** Reads input from the console using `std::io`.
- **Comparison:** Compares the user's guess with the secret number and provides appropriate feedback.
